# Construction-of-a-Comprehensive-Dimeric-Structure-of-Human-G6PD-via-a-Molecular-Docking-Approach
The project aims to construct a complete dimeric structure of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme, which is essential for initiating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in red blood cells. G6PD deficiency can lead to life-threatening anemia and hemolytic crises. The study focuses on building this structure using molecular docking software PyRx_Vina, visualization tools like PyMOL, and Biovia Discovery Studio Client to analyze NADP+ binding in the A and B chains of G6PD. The objective is to better understand the molecular mechanisms behind G6PD variants, with the hope of improving diagnosis and treatment for G6PD deficiency, a condition without approved medication.
